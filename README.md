<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<hr/>
This tool lets you experience the game like never before. Drive Tier 5 and Tier 6 cars throughout the entire story against AI of the same caliber. The Mob is no longer your only enemy, you will battle against high-performance vehicles from the very beginning. Will you be able to keep up the pace and win The Run? Only one way to find out...

FEATURES

AI opponents drive Tier 5 and Tier 6 vehicles which are constantly randomized

Gas stations have a huge variety of Tier 5 and Tier 6 vehicles to choose from

There are 20 highly customized vehicles exclusive to the player which can be driven either by hot-swapping at any gas station or by appearing as one of the choices given throughout the career

All rivals' vehicles have been changed and customized to provide a fresh look and a proper challenge when facing them in rival races


USE

Open the game before using the tool

Enable it by pressing F12 preferably before the PRESS ENTER screen

Do not close the tool once in-game, let the tool work in the background as you play

It’s compatible with Extra UI Options


EXTRAS

KNOWN ISSUES

The replacement of the string "PRESS ENTER (TO BEGIN)" works only if you launch the game with keyboard controls

Some customization parts might not look right due to the default position set for the original vehicles they were meant for

Some events might not be possible to complete if chosen a lower-performance vehicle and the AI was given very high-performance ones or if you went to the gas station for a hot-swap

If a vehicle is not customized then it might’ve been Cheat Engine omitting its particular script. Restart both, the game and the trainer

Because of how Cheat Engine trainers work, if you close its window you will still have all scripts that got enabled in the first place. In order to disable them all, you must do it manually by killing all instances of the trainer in the Task Manager



DISCLAIMER

This take of the game is thought of as an alternative to the original story mode. If you have never played it before then I suggest you do that first since the speed and complexity you are facing in this version might discourage you to continue playing

Your antivirus might detect it as a threat. It’s a false positive. The tool has been built using a custom compiled version of Cheat Engine 7.3

I am not responsible for any damage caused to your system by this tool so use it at your own risk
